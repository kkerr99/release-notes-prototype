"Sir, even though you've cut yourself off from humanity, I can see that you
haven't disowned all human feeling. We're castaways whom you've charitably
taken aboard, we'll never forget that. Speaking for myself, I don't rule out 
that the interests of science could override even the need for freedom,
which promises me that, in exchange, our encounter will provide great rewards."

withdraw.

"Ask it, professor."

"By what name am I to call you?"

"Sir," the commander replied, "to you, I'm simply Captain Nemo; to me, you and
your companions are simply passengers on the Nautilus."
